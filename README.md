# SSS-GF2m: Secret sharing over GF(2^m)

SSS-GF2m provides a python library to execute secret sharing scheme over an m-degree extension of a binary Galois Field, i.e., GF(2^m).

The aim of this library is to provide an implementation of the sophisticated secret sharing scheme based on the polynomial interpolation [[1]](#Shamir1979), which can be used as the benchmark of secret sharing scheme.
